My goal for the final project is to get back into JavaScript (it's been a while), learn some new website building stuff, all while diving into an awesome book. I'm not really sure what this project entails, but I remember a sort of mapping project I had a while back was a huge challenge for me, so I'm excited to tackle it again in a whole, new way. 

I hope my website will be fun in some way, and I hope to bring the cartoon-y style I've used in previous coding homeworks and projects into this end of semester project.
